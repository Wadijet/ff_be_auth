- Time patterns

### Security Events
- Authentication failures
- Authorization violations
- Rate limit breaches
- Input validation failures

### Suspicious Activities
- Unusual patterns
- Brute force attempts
- Data access patterns
- API abuse

### Real-time Alerts
- Threshold alerts
- Anomaly detection
- Incident notifications
- Escalation rules

## Use Cases

### 1. Performance Monitoring
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as System
    participant C as Collector
    participant D as Database
    participant A as Alerting
    
    S->>C: Send Metrics
    C->>C: Process Data
    C->>D: Store Metrics
    C->>C: Check Thresholds
    C->>A: Trigger Alert
```

### 2. Security Analysis
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as System
    participant A as Analyzer
    participant D as Database
    participant N as Notifier
    
    S->>A: Security Events
    A->>A: Pattern Analysis
    A->>D: Store Events
    A->>A: Detect Anomalies
    A->>N: Send Alerts
```

### 3. Usage Analytics
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Users
    participant S as System
    participant P as Processor
    participant D as Database
    
    U->>S: User Actions
    S->>P: Event Data
    P->>P: Process Events
    P->>D: Store Analytics
    P->>P: Generate Reports
```
