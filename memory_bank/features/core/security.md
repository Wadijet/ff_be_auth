## Use Cases

### 1. Attack Prevention
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Attacker
    participant W as WAF
    participant S as System
    
    A->>W: Malicious Request
    W->>W: Rate Check
    W->>W: IP Check
    W->>W: Input Validation
    W-->>A: Block Request
    W->>S: Log Attack
```

### 2. Audit Logging
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant S as System
    participant L as Logger
    participant D as Database
    
    U->>S: Perform Action
    S->>L: Log Event
    L->>L: Format Data
    L->>D: Store Log
    S-->>U: Response
```

### 3. Compliance Check
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Admin
    participant S as System
    participant D as Database
    participant R as Reporter
    
    A->>S: Request Report
    S->>D: Fetch Logs
    S->>R: Generate Report
    R->>R: Apply Rules
    R-->>A: Compliance Report
```
